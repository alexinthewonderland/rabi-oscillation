## Introduction
Imagine one shoots an electromagnetic (EM) wave of a specific wavelength using such as lasers to a system consisting of a ground state and an excited state. If it happens that the energy of the EM wave resonates with the energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state, then the electrons in the ground state would absorb the incoming EM wave and jumps up to the first excited state. Being in the excited state, the photons or EM waves passing through would keep travelling, however if the system de-excites, it will produce a photon with the same energy as the energy gap and the same phase as the shot EM wave. This phenomenon is called stimulated emission. The electron or system would then keep oscillating between the ground state and the excited state periodically with a certain frequency called the Rabi Frequency and thus the oscillation process is named as “Rabi Oscillation” [1].
