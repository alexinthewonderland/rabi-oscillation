## Introduction
Imagine one shoots an electromagnetic (EM) wave of a specific wavelength using such as lasers to a system consisting of a ground state and an excited state. If it happens that the energy of the EM wave resonates with the energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state, then the electrons in the ground state would absorb the incoming EM wave and jumps up to the first excited state. Being in the excited state, the photons or EM waves passing through would keep travelling, however if the system de-excites, it will produce a photon with the same energy as the energy gap and the same phase as the shot EM wave. This phenomenon is called stimulated emission. The electron or system would then keep oscillating between the ground state and the excited state periodically with a certain frequency called the Rabi Frequency and thus the oscillation process is named as ‚ÄúRabi Oscillation‚Äù [1].

Mathematically, the Rabi oscillation could be described by a periodical Hamiltonian of a simple two- level system such as the following shows

with $\ \frac{1}{2} \hbar \omega$ and $\ - \frac{1}{2} \hbar \omega$ as the excited and ground sate energy respectively, ùê∏ as the overall inference
from the applied light and thus the product of the amplitude of the electric field and coupling strength between the light and atom, and ùúî is the angular frequency of the incoming light. Thus, our goal is to solve for the wavefunction of the ground and excited states from the Schrodinger equation which states that,
